#Socket Branch
In this branch i'm trying to integreat socket.io in Laramin. And it worked till now.
Login and go to the dashboard, there it will connect to the socket.

## Usage
* login
* go to dashboard
* in your console navigate to `laramin/sockets/`
* run `node index.js`
* look in the dev tools in the console
* hit the send socket button to send and receive something to and from the server

## Todos
- [X] Make sockets working with Laramin!
- [ ] Learn how to Join Rooms ([this may helps](http://socket.io/docs/rooms-and-namespaces/))
